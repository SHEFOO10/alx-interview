# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project involves implementing an algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts, requirements, and resources to successfully complete this task.

## Concepts Covered

### Matrix Representation in Python

2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python. Elements can be accessed and modified using indices.

### In-place Operations

Operations are performed directly on the data structure without creating a copy, optimizing space complexity.

### Matrix Transposition

Transposing a matrix involves swapping rows and columns. It serves as a key step in rotating the matrix by 90 degrees.

### Reversing Rows in a Matrix

Reversing the order of rows in a matrix is essential for achieving the 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Nested Loops

Nested loops are used to iterate through the matrix and modify elements to achieve the desired rotation.

## Implementation Requirements

- **File Structure**: Ensure all files end with a newline and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation**: Document all modules and functions thoroughly.
- **Style**: Follow the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.0) guidelines for code formatting.
- **Execution**: All files must be executable.
- **No Imports**: Do not import any modules; implement the solution using basic Python functionalities.

## Tasks

### Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an n x n 2D matrix, the `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` function rotates it 90 degrees clockwise in-place.
